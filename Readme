The lib directory contains the TIXI library and the library for the fortran interface.

The include directoriy contains the include file for the TIXI C-interface.

The Demo directory contains examples how to use the TIXI library
together with a makefile showing how to compile and link programs
equipped with calls to the TIXI library. To build the demo programms
change to the Demo directory and type make. If all goes well two
executables are build tixiC and,if an appropriate fortran compiler is
available, tixi77.

tixiC expects a filename as command line parameter. The file demo.xml
is supplied, derived from an IBUCK input file for this purpose. 
When executing

tixiC demo.xml

on the command line some content of the demo.xml file is listet to the
screen and a file eigenstat.xml holding example output of IBUCK is
written.

tixi77 takes no command line arguments. It just reads the tool name
from demo.xml echos it to the screen and writes some example output to
the file blub.xml.
