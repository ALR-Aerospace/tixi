The TIXI XML Interface is available for Linux and MS-Windows platforms. We currently support TIXI for Windows and Linux, but it can be compiled on many different platforms e.g. Mac OS X, ARM based devices etc.

# Getting TIXI #
Binaries for Windows and Linux can be downloaded from the [downloads](http://code.google.com/p/tixi/downloads/list) section. In addition, the we provide the source code of the latest release or the development code can be downloaded from the [Git repository](http://code.google.com/p/tixi/source/checkout).

# Installation #
Download the installer package and install it. Set the environment variable PATH to the TIXI/lib directory.

> Hint: On Microsoft Windows you will find the environment variables under:
> `Systemsteuerung - System - Erweitert - Umgebungsvariablen`

# Building TIXI from source #
## Getting the prerequisites ##

Tixi depends on following software/libraries to build properly:
  1. cmake (http://www.cmake.org/)
  1. libxml2 (http://xmlsoft.org/)
  1. libxslt (http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/)
  1. libcurl (http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/)

### Windows ###
Download the CMake installer from http://www.cmake.org/ and install it.

The precompiled 3rd party libraries (2 - 4) for the win32 or
win64 bit architecture can be downloaded here:

| win32 | win64 |
|:------|:------|
| [lib-shared-gcc-vc7.zip](http://code.google.com/p/tixi/downloads/detail?name=lib-shared-gcc-vc7.zip) | [lib-shared-vc10-win64.zip](http://code.google.com/p/tixi/downloads/detail?name=lib-shared-vc10-win64.zip) |

Extract the appropriate zip file to e.g. `c:\development\libs`.

In addition, you will need the header files of these libraries to build tixi. Please download the package http://tixi.googlecode.com/files/3rd-party-headers.zip and extract it also to e.g. `c:\development\include`. **Please note that the zip file already contains a include directory!**

### Ubuntu / Debian Linux ###
The required software can be installed via
> `sudo apt-get install cmake-qt-gui libxslt1-dev libxml2-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev`

### Mac OS X ###
Download the CMake installer from http://www.cmake.org/ and install it.

For the other 3rd party libraries, we advise to use homebrew (http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/)
which allows an uncomplicated way of installing/compiling external software. Please download and install homebrew. The libraries are then installed via
> `brew install libxslt libxml2 cunit`

## Compiling and Installing ##
Tixi uses the CMake build system, which can generate build scripts / project files for e.g. MS Visual Studio, Apple XCode, Eclipse CDT, GNU Makefiles and many more.

CMake uses out-of-source builds, i.e. it uses a different build
directory than the source directory. After starting the CMake GUI, the locations of the source and the build directory have to be specified.

After pressing "Configure", cmake tries to find the locations of the required libraries automatically. If cmake fails, one can either specify  a global search path `ADD_INCLUDE_PATH` for header files and a path `ADD_LIB_PATH` for libraries. Alternatively, the paths for each library can be set individually. If you've downloaded the precompiled external libraries for Windows, please set the global paths `ADD_INCLUDE_PATH` to e.g. c:\development\include and do the same for `ADD_LIB_PATH` to point to the libraries.

In the configuration phase, the installation directory can be specified by setting the variable CMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX.

If the configuration succeeds, the build scripts (VC Project Files, Makefiles etc) are generated by pressing the button "Generate". The generated files can be found in the built directory. Project files (Visual Studio, Eclipse, XCode) have to be opened with the corresponding IDE. When using Makefiles, please change into the build directory and type `make`.

After a successful compilation, the compiled TIXI library and its interfaces can be
found in the "lib" directory of the build tree.

### MATLAB interface ###
In order to create the matlab interface, MATLAB has to be installed on the build system. MATLAB is currently not found automatically by CMake, thus the MATLAB installation directory has to be specified with the cmake variable "MATLAB\_DIR".

After pressing "Configure" again, cmake should find all required includes files and library files for the generation of the matlab interface.

Please make sure, that you build for the correct architecture. If your MATLAB installation is 64 bit, TIXI and the interface has to be build for 64 bit as well. Else, the interface won't work and you'll get the error message
> `invalid mex file`

### Fortran interface ###
A Fortran compiler is not required to build the Fortran interface. However, as different Fortran compilers have different name manglings, it has to be specified for which fortran system the tixi interface should be build. CMake tries to find a Fortran installation, and configures TIXI to create the interface for this FORTRAN compiler. If Fortran could not be found the variable `CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER` can be set manually. Valid options are:
  * ifort (Intel Fortran compiler)
  * gfortran
  * g77
  * g77\_irix
  * f90

### Python interface ###
If python is installed, the python interface will be automatically built at the compile phase. The resulting file `tixiwrapper.py` is located under `buildDir/lib/`. When using the tixi installer, the python wrapper can be found in `installDir/share/tixi/python/`. To install the TIXI python wrapper, please copy this file in your `python/Lib/site-packages/` folder.
